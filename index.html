                            The Women in Tech Symposium is a signature event that fosters
                            women's interest in technology and introduces them to the
                            wonder of innovation in our daily lives. This
                            is the first three-day all-Kerala summit organized by the
                            Tinkerhub WIT collective and is open to all women.
                            We create impact through
                            action, to build and set women up for success.
                            <br />
                            <br /> Because when women rise, we all rise.

                            The core objective is to bring women from all across Kerala together to learn, network,
                            and be inspired.
                            We aim to provide opportunities for women from all walks of life to attend the tech
                            conference through this programme.
                            <br><br>We believe that this would be a stepping stone to helping them break the societal
                            and gender barrier and dream high. </br>
